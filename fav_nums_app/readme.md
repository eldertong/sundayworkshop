# Sunday Workshop or Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.

  - This was my first introduction into using Bootstrap.  We gathered as a group and Heather walked us through modifying the Bootstrap to fit our purposes
  - The FavNums app is part CoinChanger and part Marv's own creation.  We used this to impliment Bootstrap as a group.
